how to run this program.

I exported it to XO_ai.jar

$ java -jar 5910546384.jar arg[0] arg[1] arg[2]

arg[0] and arg[1] is width and height of the board.

arg[2] is how many bot do you need (0 , 1 , 2)
if 1 bot will be on "O" turn

I tried for 3x3 , 4x4 

it's 100% tile. with computer playing with computer

this is not complete code for 5x4

because I tested it, it took lot of time to compelete

So i try to do time limit for computation, but the result it was not 100% accurate.
